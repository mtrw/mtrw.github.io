# About me

Call me Tim. I live in Melbourne with my partner Lauren who is also a scientist, and our beautiful baby son Max, whose hobbies include giggling and throwing food. I was born in Adelaide to a German mother and Australian father. Science and nature (plants in particular) have been my passion since I watched by first David Attenborough documentary at age 2. I'm driven by curiosity, the desire to understand the world, to help others do the same, and to apply science to the benefit of humans and the preservation of nature. When not doing science I can variously be found with my family, reading (non-fiction, classics, and textbooks mostly), camping, jamming with a band, working at some woodwork or DIY project at various scales, or (for reasons even I cannot fathom) watching Formula 1.

# My Science

I'm an evolutionary biologist and bioinformatician, with a special focus on agricultural plants. My PhD in paleoecology and ancient DNA was completed at ACAD in Adelaide. My post-doctoral career began in Germany at IPK. Since attaining an ARC DECRA award in 2024, I been growing a team of wonderful students at the University of Melbourne, in close association with the CropGEM lab. We work on projects that apply evolutionary reasoning to agricultural challenges, exploring them with the help of some creative bioinformatics. I am passionate about mentoring students to help them realise their full creative potential in analysis. I regularly lecture in a few courses and develop R packages including ReMIXTURE and BioDT. I have been privileged to play a lead role several high-profile papers in (e.g. Nature, Nature Genetics, Nature Ecology & Evolution--my first paper!), and to give many talks at international conferences.
